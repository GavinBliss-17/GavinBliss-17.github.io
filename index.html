    <h1>Welcome to Gavin Bliss's ePortfolio</h1>
    
    <h2>Professional Self-Assessment</h2>
    <p>Throughout my academic journey in the Computer Science program at SNHU, I have grown significantly as a developer. Completing my coursework and developing this ePortfolio has allowed me to showcase my strengths, shape my professional goals, and prepare for a career in the field. I have gained hands-on experience in full-stack development, data management, secure software engineering, and problem-solving techniques, which are critical to creating solutions.</p>
    
    <p>Collaborating in team environments has honed my ability to communicate effectively with stakeholders and adapt solutions to diverse needs. Through courses focused on data structures and algorithms, I have learned to create efficient, scalable solutions while managing trade-offs. My work in software engineering and databases has reinforced my skills in modular design, secure coding practices, and database optimization. I also developed a strong security mindset by considering vulnerabilities and implementing safeguards in my projects.</p>

    <p>This ePortfolio showcases how my projects come together to demonstrate my technical capabilities and industry preparation. Each artifact included highlights a specific aspect of my skills, from designing complex systems to optimizing algorithms and integrating secure databases. These artifacts collectively represent my growth as a software developer and my efforts to contribute value in the field of computer science.</p>
