    <h1>Welcome to Gavin Bliss's ePortfolio</h1>
    
    <h2>Professional Self-Assessment</h2>
    <p>Throughout my academic journey in the Computer Science program at SNHU, I have grown significantly as a developer. Completing my coursework and developing this ePortfolio has allowed me to showcase my strengths, shape my professional goals, and prepare for a career in the field. I have gained hands-on experience in full-stack development, data management, secure software engineering, and problem-solving techniques, which are critical to creating solutions.</p>
    
    <p>Taking the time to understand team environments has better prepared me to communicate effectively with stakeholders and build solutions around their needs. Through courses focused on data structures and algorithms, I have learned to create efficient solutions while managing trade-offs. My work in software engineering and databases has reinforced my skills in modular design, secure coding practices, and database optimization. I also developed a strong security mindset by considering vulnerabilities and implementing safeguards in my projects.</p>

    <p>This ePortfolio showcases how my projects come together to demonstrate my technical capabilities and industry preparation. Each artifact included highlights a specific aspect of my skills, from designing complex systems to optimizing algorithms and integrating secure databases. These artifacts collectively represent my growth as a software developer and my efforts to contribute value in the field of computer science.</p>

    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I'm a computer science student focused on software development and bettering my ability to solve problems. Throughout my academic journey, I've developed skills in programming languages like Python, C++, and Java. I have gained hands-on experience in full-stack development and data management. My projects reflect my dedication to creating efficient, secure, and user-centered applications.</p>

    <h2>Code Review</h2>
    <div class="code-review">
        <p><strong>Watch the Code Review:</strong> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_DG94eLmr0" target="_blank">Code Review Video</a></p>
        <p>The code review provides a comprehensive analysis of three key projects: ScaleSage, Q-Learning Pirate Maze, and Travlr Getaways. The purpose of the review was to identify strengths and propose improvements in software engineering, algorithms, and database management.</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Software Engineering and Design (ScaleSage):</strong> Focused on UI design, data visualization, and error handling with recommendations for modularizing UI elements and enhancing user feedback.</li>
            <li><strong>Algorithms and Data Structures (Q-Learning Pirate Maze):</strong> Evaluated the Q-learning implementation and suggested optimizations such as epsilon decay, prioritized experience replay, and enhanced training metrics.</li>
            <li><strong>Databases (Travlr Getaways):</strong> Reviewed the database schema, API controllers, and security settings, with proposals for schema enhancements, RBAC, and additional analytics-focused routes.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Overall, the review provided actionable insights to improve usability, performance, and maintainability across all projects.</p>
